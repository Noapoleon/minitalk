TODO:

THINK ABOUT:
	- Simultaneous input from 2 clients or more (broadcast terminator)
	- How to send characters and if it's not possible to make some sort of
	  package structure where piece of data sent has info about it's position
	  and which packet (not sure that this term applies here) it belongs here)
	- What victordinateur did about pid being too high and if that is actually
	  a problem or none at all

DONE:
