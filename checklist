TODO:
	- [IMP] client loop change to allow longer than 2048 chars because if client
	  sends more than 2048 characters server right now will crash
	- server array for multiple client inputs AT THE SAME TIME, right now if two
	  clients send things at the same time messages will probably be mixed
	- send siguser2 a client in case of error
	- if server doesn't receive \0 byte withing 3 seconds report and error and
	  free s_cli_msg struct from list;

THINK ABOUT:
	- Simultaneous input from 2 clients or more (broadcast terminator)
	- How to send characters and if it's not possible to make some sort of
	  package structure where piece of data sent has info about it's position
	  and which packet (not sure that this term applies here) it belongs here)
	- What victordinateur did about pid being too high and if that is actually
	  a problem or none at all
	- protect minitalk from someone entering the wrong pid or entering something
	  like -1 which would be desastrous
	- grep for forbidden functions: printf, perror, atoi

WAYS TO CRASH/LEAK MINITALK:
	- Server:
		* fake client sends non null terminated string -> server will never free
		  the client struct
		* 

DONE:
