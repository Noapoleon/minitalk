TODO:
	- [IMP] client loop change to allow longer than 2048 chars because if client sends
	  more than 2048 characters server right now will crash
	- server array for multiple client inputs AT THE SAME TIME, right now if two
	  clients send things at the same time messages will probably be mixed
	- send siguser2 a client in case of error

THINK ABOUT:
	- Simultaneous input from 2 clients or more (broadcast terminator)
	- How to send characters and if it's not possible to make some sort of
	  package structure where piece of data sent has info about it's position
	  and which packet (not sure that this term applies here) it belongs here)
	- What victordinateur did about pid being too high and if that is actually
	  a problem or none at all

DONE:
